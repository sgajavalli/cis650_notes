Try these commands at the interactive Pyton prompt at the terminal

```
a,b = 1,2 #positional assignments.  What value does b get?
s = 'spam'
a,b,c,d = 'spam' #unpacks and assigns
x = y = 4  #what value does x get?
x = 10
x += 4
x *= 4 # x*4 is assigned to x
s = 'spam'
s += 'eggs'
#Swapping values
x = 1
y = 2
x, y
x, y = y, x
x, y
#boolean expressions
True
bool(1)

bool(2.3)
bool('abc')
bool('')
2 or 3
3 or 2
2 and 3
bool(None)
# more boolean expressions
x = 1
y = 1.0
x == y
x != y
x >y
x>=y
x<=y
x<y
#Python has a conditional assignment feature
x = 15
y = 100 if x>=10 else 200  
print(y)
