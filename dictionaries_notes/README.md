A dictionary is an unordered collection which stores keyâ€“value pairs that map immutable keys to values, just as a conventional dictionary maps words to definitions.
Dictionaries can contain objects of any types; and they support nesting
fetched by key (instead of position as in list). You create dictionaries with literals and access items by key. uses Key-Value pairs
Each key can have one associated value
In contrast with lists that sequentially number each item (the index), dictionaries allow you to name each item

1. Dictionary usage
Sequence operations do not work; Dictionaries are mappings, not sequence
Assigning new indices adds entries
keys need not be strings

2. Benefits of dictionary
Lookup is faster (dictionaries are structured so all keys don't need to be searched)
The dictionary arrangement is more tightly connected (one variable) Related, maintaining the dictionary is less error-prone than maintaining parallel lists
Capturing more information is possible with a dictionary of dictionaries
